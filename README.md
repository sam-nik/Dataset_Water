Water Images Collection


Overview

Welcome to the Water Images Collection repository! This project curates a comprehensive dataset of water images, meticulously organized into three distinct sets: medium, tiny, and full. Within each set, you'll find four folders, each dedicated to portraying different water conditionsâ€”namely, algae, clean, muddy, and polluted water.

The primary objective of this initiative is to furnish a diverse and meticulously curated dataset. This collection is designed to cater to a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from image recognition and machine learning to environmental studies and beyond. The carefully categorized images offer a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and enthusiasts alike.

You are invited to leverage these high-quality images for research, educational endeavors, or any other non-commercial purposes. If you find this dataset beneficial to your work, we kindly request that you provide proper attribution to this repository.
